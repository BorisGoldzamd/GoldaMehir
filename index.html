        <h3 class="item"><strong>Golda Meir's Leadership During the Yom Kippur War</strong></h3>
        <p class="item">Golda Meir played a pivotal role in the Yom Kippur War (1973), a conflict between Israel and a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria. As the Prime Minister of Israel at that time, Meir faced a critical moment in the nation's history. Despite initial intelligence failures and surprise attacks on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, Golda Meir's leadership and determination were instrumental in mobilizing Israeli forces, securing international support, and ultimately turning the tide of the war in favor of Israel. Her decisions during this challenging period showcased resilience and strategic acumen, making her a central figure in the history of Israel's defense.</p>
